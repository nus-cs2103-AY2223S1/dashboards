There's a bit of code duplication here where the idea of "splitting and matching the first word, then getting the rest of the string" is repeated multiple times. Can this common idea be perhaps abstracted away, perhaps with other functions like this?
```java
public static boolean isOfTheCommand(String input, String commandName) {
    String[] splitStr = input.split(" ");
    return splitStr[0].equals(commandName));
}
public static boolean getCommandBody(String input) {
    String[] splitStr = input.split(" ");
    String type = splitStr[0];
    return input.substring(type.length() + 1);

Instead of checking the command, perhaps you check the negation since you already have a default case below. Since you are only checking for list perhaps use `boolean hasDescription = !command.equals("list");`
However to account for the checking of missing description, perhaps you can actually abstract out CommandWithDescription from the various commands and throw the missing description error there as an exception?

Uncaught `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException`. 
While you did specify a length of 3, however, if the line is say `Test ] test`, it will not actually give you an array of length 3!
Perhaps you can add an assertion or check to make sure that the array is of length 3 before proceeding.
You might argue it is an save file, but there are always chances for the file to become corrupt or modified so I think this is something you should take note.

Hello, you did not catch ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. 
It can occur when you have a line like `D | 0 | ` in the `DataStorage.txt`
Even though you specified `input.split(" \\| ", 4);`, when there is not enough seperators, it can still lead to an array that is smaller than the specified amount of parameters.
Since you are trying to catch corrupted lines, perhaps you can add a check to the array length or catch the OutOfBound to account for this.

Looks alright, but some points to take note of:
1. Header comments for JavaDocs in present tense verb, "Adds..., Returns...,Gets..." and the first letter should be capitalised
2. Method names should be verbs and camelCase
3. Order of imports
4. Switch statement indentation

I'm not very sure if possible error that can be thrown by parseInt has been handled. For instance if user types in unmark hello when it should be unmark 1. I checked the Parser class and it does not seem to have handled this case. Perhaps can consider throwing some exception here or somewhere higher in the chain.

In general, looks pretty good. Import statements are in the right order for the files I saw, static imports first etc. Indentation and Egyptian style braces are also in place.

However, take note of the conventions for JavaDocs
1. First sentence as short summary of method, should be in present tense form "Adds..., Returns..., Sends..."
2. First letter for parameter description should be capitalised, E.g. @param zone Zone of position

Other than that, I think the Java coding standards were largely followed. Good job!

What if `parseInt` throw an exception? 

Even though the number is checked with regex during parsing, I feel it might be better to handle the exception.
Or even better approach is to make the Parser also parse the index, and call this method with the index. This way all the parsing will be done in one place and the exceptions related to parsing can also be thrown from one place.

+1 to [Lezheng's comment](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S1/ip/pull/237/files#r959589248), but perhaps you could name that folder "task" instead of "Command".

A bit of a nitpick but perhaps this method could be renamed? `render` usually has other meanings (I'm thinking 3D render etc). I like your description in the accompanying javadocs, so perhaps `convertStringToTask` would be a more intuitive name?

I may be wrong, but perhaps it would be better to remove the default case if you are not doing anything useful inside. I understand the defensive logic with the `task != null` check but during the loading of the text file, if for some reason you were to read a `taskType` that was not `T`, `D` or `E`, would it be better to remove that line from the text file to avoid persisting invalid data?

I may be wrong but so far I've seen all of your `DukeException`s prefixed with `INDENTATION` (which is just whitespace(?) ). Perhaps you could abstract this padding directly into the constructor of `DukeException`? Again, on the surface, to me it seems like a good piece to abstract out.

Since you have a relatively long chain of code to run, it might be better to omit the `this` at the start of the code and just use `tasks.get(index).done(true)` instead. This also applies to all the instances of `this.tasks` you used in this `ChatBot` Class.

Isn't this method a little confusing, since it has the same name as the variable being passed inside? It might be better if it was called `markTaskDone()` or `markDone()` in short. The variable passed could be changed to `boolean taskCompletionStatus` for greater clarity as well.

Similarly, you could abstract out

Ah okay, I realised you are creating a new `Task` with this constructor in the `Storage` Class when you are reading in the duke.txt file to create the new `Task` instance based on whether the `Task` was marked done or not. I guess this could work then. 

What I did was to create a default undone `Task`, then just subsequently use an if else statement to check for '1' or '0' and simply call the respective `markDone()` and `markUndone()` methods. This can remove the need for a Constructor overload üôÇ

I've only commented out violations of code quality guidelines, and I believe there are some coding standards to correct as well. 
Also, not very sure if all the extra lines after the method and class declarations are necessary. It might save a lot more LoC if the empty lines were omitted for shorter code that is easier to read. üòÑ

A possible consideration would be to pass the entire String into the Event class and throw the errors from this class to be handled in the main class. This applies for your others tasks as well.

This function seems to be more than 100 lines long and explicitly declares the implementations of all parsed instructions.

There seems to be an error in this function, it mentions that it would like to return a copy of the ArrayList, but the current implementation will result in aliasing the list. Perhaps consider cloning and casting the result?

        return temp;
    }
```

Although, I'm unsure this if this a documentation error. If so, maybe it would be a better choice to describe the function as `Retrieves the current TaskList`, as the word `copy` may indicate the explicit acting of copying over the objects to a new collection.

It seems like `Duke::mark` and `Duke::unmark` perform roughly the same procedure with only a differing call to the Ui object.

Overall looks good and runs as expected. Week 3's project outline provides an Address Book example which exemplifies good OOP practices and organises all its classes and packages in a clear and concise manner. The Parser object should strictly handle parsing of the input and return a Command object. The Command object should take in (Tasklist, UI, Storage) and handle execution of the given command (handled by the TaskList object), store the updated task list (handled by the Storage object) and display the messages (handled by the UI object). Good to check out the Address Book example and align your code with the example given in the project outline :)

LGTM! The few nits to deal with in my opinion are just the capitalization and spacing issues, this can be resolved by doing `A-CheckStyle` as I haven't seen any tags on this at the moment of writing.

One thing in particular that I'm delighted about is the noticeable abstraction here. You seem to put different commands in separate classes, as well as different types of exceptions as well. I can see there's a lot of effort put in here, good job! üòÉ

I think "@return A boolean." feels rather redundant since the method signature would already tell me the method returns a boolean. Maybe adding a short description like "@return true if number is valid" would fit better here even though it might feel abit repetitive since it can be inferred from your main description.

similar to what i mentioned above, i observe that you choose to linebreak in your javadoc after a small number of characters quite frequently. personally i feel this makes it harder to read as it breaks up a single sentence into many pieces. furthermore breaking the sentence up this early makes it seem like you apply a different line length limit for your javadoc and for your code below which can make it feel abit inconsistent and confusing.

i am not sure if theres a need to line break this early since it seems like there isnt that many characters in your first line. let me know if i missed any style requirement for this üëç

i notice that this line variable seem to exist in many of your classes for the purpose of printing and it feels rather repetitive. i havent read your full implementation of dukebot in detail but maybe its possible to reduce this repetition by storing this line variable in a user interface class and getting the line variable from that class or calling a method from that class to handle printing for you.

furthermore it seems like in the Storage class the "line" variable is not used at all, i think this line can be removed too üëç

Any reason why you decided to put the `by` attribute as part of `Task` class? Perhaps it will be better to have it as an attribute of `Deadline` class as it is only applicable to `Deadline` class and not other class that inherit from `Task`. Same goes for other fields such as `at`.

I dislike how this class is structured. I suggest having all of Duke's responses listed at the top of the class as constants, and then the class methods would be methods to print those constants. 

Benefits of my suggested change:
This would make editing these greetings much easier to manage as all the strings are at the top of the class.

In addition, if in the future you need to make Ui return the strings it uses in greetings for some reason, this implementation would make such a thing far easier.

Nice control flow and storage system, so I like the ideas behind it. However, I have a few suggestions to make regarding this structure.

There is far too many nested if statements. I suggest at least abstracting away the ```if(<task>.equals("<task>")``` blocks into a separate method in the task class itself, or maybe even in the ```Parser``` class as a static method. Another layer of abstraction possible is to separate the entire if block here into another method in this class, simply to reduce the levels of nested if statements and to reduce the size of this method.

The system is slightly too optimistic regarding the user. For example, if the user typos and accidentally has // in their task description.

I like many of the ideas in this iP. There are some clever bits of code and I like the effort made to create exceptions that extend from DukeException. I also like most of the method names and I think good effort has been made to ensuring coding style conventions have been met. JavaDocs look complete, and there really is not much to complain about.

The only change I would suggest is the one in the ```load()```method of ```Storage``` as it does not utilize Abstraction and overuses nested if statements thus violating coding style contentions.

I didn't like how undescriptive this method name is. You have other methods with which you use to parse other inputs. 

Perhaps consider renaming this method to ```parseCommand``` instead?

I didn't like this solution for deleting a task from TaskList. 

Consider the scenario where your try block throws an Exception that is not IOException. Perhaps it throws an unchecked exception. In this scenario, you would lose the task to be added back into the TaskList because the catch block is not executed. This is a prime example of using Exceptions as control flow, which is something you should avoid.

Perhaps consider separating the file rewriting process from the task deletion process. The TaskList failing to be stored or rewritten should not mean that the delete command fails entirely.

I like that you combined both Mark and Unmark command into a single command. It is a very efficient use of code. Really clean.

I really like this method that you used to turn tasks into storage. If given the time, I would want to try to do the same as well. The idea is really solid.

My only concern is an ignorant or malicious user. What if they run a command like 
todo try | have to complete project

**Review Status:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

Overall I think your project is really clean. and has a lot of great ideas and implementations of OOP concepts. I really liked the combination of MarkCommand and UnmarkCommand into a single UpdateStatusCommand.

However, it makes a few errors in using exceptions for control flow and is also slightly too idealistic regarding the user giving bad inputs. 

Also, there are a few module coding convention violations with wildcard imports and the switch case clauses.

Just a suggestion, but I think the code would look cleaner if there was a separate helper function to check the formatting of the commands (i.e. whether or not the arguments are valid).

And to check the formatting of commands, maybe you might want to consider using the Array.split() command instead of regex. The code might be more readable that way, and there would also be less hard coding (of regex expressions) involved!

Overall I think the code is pretty decent! The respective components of the Duke bot were abstracted out as per the OOP principles, and the CS2103T coding standard was mostly followed. My only gripe is the structure of the Task classes/subclasses, I feel it would be better if the Tasks were organised into their own separate classes (possibly in a separate package) instead of being a subclass of TaskList.

Hello Wei Quan, I think it would be clearer to use a noun as a variable name, as the preposition 'at' could also be used in front of a location.
```suggestion
    private LocalDate startTime;
```

Hi Wei Quan, the method name `getStorageFormat` effectively communicates that this method is meant to encode a `Task` as a `String` for storage. Other authors I reviewed have used names such as `stringify`, which is problematic because it does not self-explain the difference between `stringify` and `toString`.

However, I think it would be clearer to use `String.format()` here. It might be unnecessary to use `getStatusBit()`.

```suggestion
        return String.format("%d | %s", this.isDone ? 1 : 0, this.description);

Hi Wei Quan, I thought that the naming conventions were well-followed in this method -- the method name `get` is a verb, the temporary variable `tasksMatched` and the parameter `keyword` is self-explanatory.

Hello Wei Quan, the field `by` could be renamed to the noun `dueDate` to better explain what it represents. Otherwise, `by` could also potentially refer to the person who added this task.

Once again, I think using `String.format()` would make it easier to see where whitespace will end up in the display format.

Hello Wei Jun, I would recommend following the conventions:
1. The name of each test method should follow the following format:
`featureUnderTest_testScenario_expectedBehavior()`
2. Strive towards having one `assert` statement in each test method.

Hi Wei Jun,
I like how the fields and methods are named. It is easy to tell that `isDone` is a boolean just from its name. The method names also all start with verbs.
However, the name `task` could be more descriptive. May I suggest `description`?

Hi Shawn, it was not immediately obvious what `at` meant. I would like to suggest using a more descriptive name, such as `startTime`.
```suggestion
    protected LocalDateTime startTime;

Hi Shawn, separating the operands to `+` in `System.out.println()` and aligning them neatly helped me understand what was meant to be printed in one glance.

However, I think this method (and similar methods) could be better named as `displayDeleteDescription`.

Renaming `tasks` to `remainingTasks` helps convey that this method is only called after the task has been deleted (though it can admittedly be inferred from the context).

```suggestion
    public static void displayDeleteDescription(List<Task> remainingTasks, Task deletedTask) {
```

I like how `"todo ".length()` was not replaced with the magic number `5`!

This helps me understand that we are getting the name of the task by omitting the first five characters.

I should adopt this in my code as well.

```suggestion
    public String encodeTask() {
```

Hi Shawn, I think this renaming will help to communicate how `stringifyTask` is different from `toString`.

I liked the use of `String.format()`. It helped me immediately understand the encoding scheme. In comparison, the alternative would be `return ("T|" + this.isDone ? "1" : "0" + "|" + this.description)`, which is nowhere as elegant.

This is based on what I understand so far from your code.

You have a set of valid inputs declared earlier, and here you use the switch case statement to check which valid command the input matches, but this is only after an if statement basically checking if the first word matches any valid commands.

If so, then logically (assuming your program works as it should) the default case should never occur right? 

If that is so, I think it would make more sense to simply have it be empty, and instead, at **line 91** below (reached after there is an invalid input), the error message can be included as `"Wrong input"`, instead of being blank. Would that be better?

For our coding standards, I think we're having the `case` clauses on the same indent level as the `switch` statements. So maybe something like this?

Overall your code follows the coding style conventions quite closely, though I think you made a few careless mistakes here and there.

Perhaps you may want to make the Scanner name slightly longer than just "s" as it can be slightly confusing since the method also deals heavily with Strings? I think simply making it "sc" would also help improve clarity.

I think the formatting for javadocs is a bit off here. Usually there is a blank line after your method description and there is no blank lines between the block tags (Eg. @param, @return, @throws). Also, end your descriptions with a full stop.

Instead of doing a check for unknown commands here, maybe it will be clearer if you shift this integrate this check into the switch statement below (L33-L55).

For example:

```java
switch (command) {
.

default:
    throw new DukeException("...");

Great job at setting `FILE_PATH` as `final`!

Since you have already initialize the values for each `TaskType` enum (seen below), perhaps it will be good to reuse that enum to do input checking instead.

This is so that you will not need to change the logic for input checking twice when a situation arises in the future

I guess at this point there are only a few different type of `Tasks`, so there doesnt seem to be the need to componentize the parsing logic for each add task command (for example a dedicated parser for different type of different `addTasks`)

However, I would think it will be still be good practise to separate out the parsing logic so that it is also easier pin out the source of bugs if there are any. Additionally it also introduce better separation of concern, allowing us to better handling different command formats effectively.

Instead of handling the printing of UI responses from within each task action for example `deleteTask` in thie case, perhaps it would be better if there is a dedicated class/component that handles that. This is so that when more features are added or a GUI is incorporated,  it is easily to adapt and change to the new structure.

For example instead of having `void deleteTask`, it could be a `Response deletTask` where each action returns a structured `Response` output that is subsequently used by a `Ui` class/component to do the appropiate UI output.

Some additional test cases you can consider:

1. Invalid comand formats for `deadline`, `event` and `mark`
    - e.g. `deadline /by Sunday`, `event project meeting /by Mon`, `mark a`
2. Tests for `delete` command 
3. What should be the expected output of `list` if there are no tasks yet in the `taskList`
4. Error messages when a invalid command is given
    - Test for the correct error message for commands like `mark a`
5. Tests for unsupported commands (e.g. `hello`)
6. For completeness sake, the expected output of `bye` command üòÖ

However, I think code readability can be better improved (e.g. avoiding reliance on many if statements and replacing with switch statements, and following more closely Java coding standard: https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html).

Perhaps to make the method name shorter, you could consider wrapping the whole parse method in a try-catch? So you don't have to explicitly mention that it throws DukeException sooo something like

    try { //main logic 
     
    } catch (DukeException d) {
    // handle the exception here

Maybe I could ask why these checks are repeated / done in storage repeatedly? The way I might do it would be to create a static factory class within each of deadline/todo/event, and call an appropriate constructor depending on whether it is 'E', 'T' or 'D'. 

In general, I think you could consider trying to abstract out the parsing of the saveData and creation into a seperate parser class / within each Event/Deadline/Task class itself, and not attempt to create it within Storage :D Could save on repetition of code, and it might make use of better OOP principles!

Perhaps using ```length()``` to express these numbers in accordance to the length of the command might be better so that the numbers do not look like "magic numbers".

Overall well written and compliant with the coding standard set in CS2103T. 

However, there are a few areas where there are redundant empty lines inserted which looked quite weird and spacing and line breaks could be more consistent as well. These are quite common mistakes that we will make so I would suggest actually setting up a code formatter or IntelliJ's auto format on save.

Keep up the good work!

Overall your program is pretty awesome. The structure and program flow are clear. I like how regex is being used in your code, it is quite efficient.

Overall, I feel that your program is pretty good, the structure is there and especially I like the way how you customize the response from Drake. üòÑ  

However just some minor issues here. I notice that you write everything in your main method, which I guess, is not a good practice if you would like to build extension (include extra features). I guess you actually had a sense of it already as `A-MoreOOP` is one of this IP requirements to met.

Yeah so I think once you abstracted your code in main method into methods from multiple classes, your program would be kind of flawless (based on my understanding). üëÄ 

I understand that this might take some time (personally I took one whole day to settle this OOP requirement), yup so if you need any help can always drop me a message. Also you could check out IP code from others on our IP dashboard to get a sense on how to organize different classes. üëç

Hi Samuel, overall your adherence to the Java Coding Standard is pretty good üòÑ  and I found it easy to understand and read. However, do take note of some minor "errors" that I have pointed out in the PR. Also, it would be even better if you could package similar classes into separate packages for easier reference and readability in view of future extensions.

I noted a few minor coding standard & naming violations too. 
Consider renaming some methods/variables.

Following code quality guidelines, they don't really like many levels of indentation. Maybe can consider splitting up the if statements so won't have to nest this if statement. Something like:
```
Task task = t.get(i);
if (task == null) {
    continue;
}
if (task.getStatusIcon().equals("X")) {
  ...
} else {
...
}

- Consider moving all print statements into the Ui class. You have access to it through the ui argument in deconstruct

it may not be a wise choice for a public method to have a parameter with the most general class Object. I notice that it doesn't break your code or anything since every object has a `toString()` method but this allows anyone importing the Storage class to write anything into the file. I'm not sure that's a good idea.

Agree that it is short and concise. But perhaps some of the abstraction are too "deep"? (e.g. command can separate into classes and show how does Duke run). I find it hard to understand with only ui.introduction( ) in the run( ) method in the beginning üòñ

In general, I found the code very well structured and easy to follow. The use of fallthroughs in switch statements seems to go against recommended practices, but I don't think it is an issue as the codebase is still small.

Comments can also be deleted; there are many redundant comments. For example,
```java
  // Constructors
    public ToDo(String description) {
        super(description);
    }
```

I found the naming to be very good, and there were long, descriptive names where appropriate, so that was nice and easy to follow code logic.

`Integer.valueOf` actually uses `parseInt` internally, but it returns a type of Integer rather than int. I just thought for your case, `parseInt` was good enough. No major performance issues if I recall correctly.

public static int parseInt(String s) throws NumberFormatException {
    return parseInt(s, 10);
}

public static Integer valueOf(String s, int radix) throws NumberFormatException {
    return Integer.valueOf(parseInt(s, radix));
}

    return Integer.valueOf(parseInt(s, 10));

Maybe this function could be optimised to make use of lambda functions.
The function `printf` also provides the functionality of both `println` and `String.format`.

I really like how you have all the accepted input formats in one place/array! Perhaps you could also consider using or maybe adding predefined [DateTimeFormatter constants](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ISO_LOCAL_DATE) from the Java API?

Additionally, though I find the use of booleans more elegant, do you think that perhaps using integer representations (0=not done, 1 = done, 2=in progress, etc.) makes the code more extendable, given we can add more 'status of completion' values?

I really like how you catch errors in this method! Do you think that perhaps Java String [split method with regex ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)) instead of using `substring` might help make the method briefer?

Overall, I find the code relatively easy to read and understand. Although as mentioned in the specific comments, perhaps you might want to add JavaDocs whenever possible and possibly refactor your code into subclasses/methods, to make your code even more readable. Apart from that, there are minor violations of the code quality guidelines and coding standard conventions, but I'm sure those can be rectified very easily. All the best!

Considering that the methods will be invoked on a `TaskList`, I think that prefixing `list` to each of the methods in this class is redundant, and potentially misleading in the case of `listDelete` which suggests that it deletes an entire list.

Great work! Your code is pleasant to read, and there are some neat Java features that were used (such as the `Serializable` interface)!

I would suggest taking a look at the commented-out lines and some of the method names though, as the coding quality standard recommends that method names should start with a verb.

LGTM! I think your code is well-written in terms of documentation and follows the coding standards very well. In terms of code quality, I think the naming aspect was very well done when reviewing your code. Just some small suggestions regarding having complicated expressions and the ordering of import statements. Good job! üëç

I think some of these strings can be combined. If I recall correctly, string concatenation in Java is O(length of string) so unnecessary use of the + operator should be avoided. For example the `"\n"` can just be added to the end of the previous string. I've noticed this in several of the other files too.

for the methods in this class, I felt that the naming seems to communicate to me that these methods are actually doing what it's saying (eg. `findTask` tells me that this method is for finding a task, rather than displaying the UI that goes with it) I would suggest adding something like `displayFindTask` or `showDeleteTaskMessage`? what do you think?

I don't think I like that you added a dash ("-") before writing the description for each parameter. I have seen this in other places as well.

To add, I realised some inconsistency in adding dashes in return statements, e.g. in this case you didn't, but you did at getUserCommand() of Ui.java.

Overall, I like the way you tried to incorporate SWE principles into IP. Although at this point of the review you have yet to start on Level-10, thus far your project looks great! You could incorporate more test cases and put all classes that inherit Task into a separate package for better organisation. I hope the suggestions given are useful.

Overall, this looks good to me. However, there are a few cases where the variable names are short and in contracted form and it does not look obvious to me what they represent. There is also an isolated case where the JavaDoc comment is empty. Consider using more readable variable names if that makes sense.

Overall, your code looks good to me. I found very minor issues in your code, but I may not have found all. I suggest you utilize the Checkstyle file. OOP is used well throughout, but your Parser class might be slightly too long. Do consider splitting these methods into more classes. Other than that, your code looks excellent!

Overall, the code is really structured and really well written. It is really impressive! There are some minor changes that need to be made, but mistakes were really hard to find throughout. One main issue I found was the very long class, namely Parser. Split some of these methods in the class and delete some redundant methods if possible. Finally, don't forget to add your PR description!

I like the usage of the term "position" as it indicates that you are referring to the position (starting from index 1) instead of the common "index" (starting from index 0) which most programmers like to use. Using the position term clarifies the need of when you need to subtract by 1.

Overall, good effort to abstract out the classes and obeying the OOP principles! Just take note that the overall readability could be further improved; some indentations are not very consistent and may impede the readability.

You may want to use enums to capture the different strings that pertain to each command, in order to facilitate re-use and consistency across files that use these names (e.g Duke.java).

I feel a bit uneasy with this `getList()` public method since if anyone can access this, they can freely modify it as well. Alternatively, I was thinking this can be replaced with getting the total length of the taskList, then getting the tasks separately from the index with your `getTask()` method. This way, the getList() method is not needed anymore since I think its only used once here.

    case "unmark":
        this.unmark = new UnMarkCommand(ui, stor, arrayLL);
        unmark.complete(arr[1]);
        break;
    case "delete":
        this.delete = new DeleteCommand(ui, stor, arrayLL);
        delete.complete(arr[1]);
        break;
    case "deadline": 
        //add the other cases and code in
        //below until the default case
    default:
        //throw NeoException if the command string does not match any of the cases
        throw new NeoException("Sorry I don't know what that means");
}

There was a lot of instances where operators was found not being surrounded by a space character (Java coding standard), for example:
üëé practice: `a=(b+c)*d;`
üëç practice: `a = (b + c) * d;`
same goes for all other operators like `>, &gt;, ||, &&` etc

LGTM! There were a few user interactions (e.g. println and readLine) in your Parser class that I believe could be given to the UI class to handle, and some bits of code in the constructors are duplicated and can be simplified a bit (e.g. using the this() keyword to call its constructor). The code style however was really great and there were close to no issues with it!

I enjoyed looking at your code and learnt quite a bit from it! I particularly like how you broke the commands down, and implemented an interface and stub for storage. Your implementation is very detailed and accounts for many potential source of errors!

One suggestion would simply be to add some comments to make your code easier to follow since it is more complicated than most implementations! Well done though!

I am not sure if the try-catch here is really necessary. From what I understand, if any error did occur (possibly when loading the list), it should be handled by either the `Storage` class or the `Parser` class? Perhaps you might want to change the `Exception` to be more specific so as to avoid catching all exceptions when debugging?

Again, consider using a switch statement.
A switch fallthrough can be used to deal with the Deadline (line 115) and Event (line 120) cases elegantly.

    // Code for Todo

I like that you used the switch clause to effectively separate the logic of each command. However, some commands seem to require parsing the user input in similar fashions (mark and unmark, deadline and event).

I like how you use inheritance to reduce code duplication! Since ```Task``` does not seem to be instantiated in your code, maybe you could make it an abstract class!

It seems like the child classes are not able to take advantage of this method by calling ```super.fullDesc()```, perhaps you could tweak the method in ```Task``` slightly such that you can further abstract out the code?

Overall structure seems okay! I like the use of inheritance, but I believe some tweaks will make your code look much cleaner. All the best in fixing your code :&hat;)

Instead of having two methods that do almost the same thing that differ only based on the input and output method, how about abstracting the I/O into a different class(es)? Then you could have a single method read from that class' input method and output to that class' output method.

This entire switch case statement is a little bit unreadable, I would consider adding more vertical spacing and seeing where you can abstract out some of your logic. 

for example, does it make sense for you to do your error check and throwing here? or should they be abstracted into your classes? `Ask Don't Tell`.

Perhaps it's good to shorten the method length by creating separate methods to handle the `System.out.println` and parsing commands? So that it can follow this coding standard:

> Avoid Long Methods

Be wary when a method is longer than the computer screen, and take corrective action when it goes beyond 30 LOC (lines of code). The bigger the haystack, the harder it is to find a needle.

I like how you've abstracted all the error messages into its own class! It makes your job easier if you were to change the error messages in the future. However, according to the coding standard,

so perhaps you may consider renaming them!

These two lines are a little tough for me to understand at first glance. I understand that writing everything in one compact line looks aesthetically nice, but it compromises on readability. May I suggest defining variables to for `rest.indexOf("/by")` and `rest.subList(...)`. Just a suggestion!

Overall, code is well formatted and follows the coding standard closely. Well done! The only minor issue is the static imports, but at least you were consistent in having the static imports come after the non-static imports in all your files.

One other suggestion is to organise your files into separate packages based on their functions, e.g. one package for Task classes, one package for GUI classes, etc.

I notice this logic of formatting the Task objects in a printable list is already present in the list() method above.

Overall, I like the flow of logic you used and it was easy to read and understand.
You may consider creating separate class files for your subclasses in `Action` and `Task` and package them under `action` and `task` packages for instance, as there is an increment A-Packages where you organise your classes into packages. It also makes your code more compact and less verbose. I also like the personality of your Duke bot!

I'm slightly concern about the public `getTasks()` method as anyone can access this and they can modify your array. Alternatively, I was thinking this method can be a `getTask(int index)` method that returns `Task` at a specific index instead of `ArrayList&gt;Task>`. In the rest of the files, the task list can be passed in as parameter and in the body you can `getTask(int index)` and then continue with the logic.

I have noticed several places with such `ui.showMessage("String")`. Since the `Ui` class should be handling all the interactions with the users, I think it would be better if you can abstract this section out and have a corresponding function in `Ui` to handle this request?

It can be seen that much effort has been put into writing this work and most of the function namings and variable namings are following the required conventions.

Considering the progress of the writer so far (till Level-8 as declared in the tag), he or she might need to put in more time into writing this project.

But still, good job for the decent code quality!

Since if the named file already exits `createNewFile()` does nothing and return false, maybe this part can be further simplified? \
Besides, the `IOException` will be thrown if the file already exits, if that's the intended behaviour maybe it would be clearer if the error message indicate that file already exits?

Overall I really like your naming of methods and variables as it is very obvious what the methods and variables are for. However, there are some minor errors with the Javadoc comments, and if possible, try to use `switch case` if there are multiple `else if` statements as the code will look neater.

Seems like after each "if" or "else if" statement, there seem to be many lines of code manipulating the taskString. Perhaps can consider placing all these code into a method in the parser class(after the conditional statement), so that the code here would be more readable

Hi Wei Quan, I don't think this is a coding standard violation but I was wondering if it is better to declare constants for your respective cases? I suggest this because if you're managing a super large codebase and you somehow have to check for these `inputCommands` , a constant may save you the time taken to find these hard-coded commands.

Hi, again, not a coding standard violation but I was wondering if adding Task behind the respective classes for tasks will be better? I feel it allows readers to easily navigate to the type of task they want to see. Also, Event could be misleading as it can represent things like button onClick events etc

Hi, not exactly a coding violation but I was thinking to append 'Task' behind the class names for the types of Tasks?
```suggestion
public class DeadlineTask extends Task {
```
I would say this could be more useful for classes that potentially have multiple meanings -&gt; Event could refer to button onClick event etc. People who view your code base can also easily navigate to whichever task type they want to review easily.

Perhaps you may want to name boolean variables such that there is a prefix in front to make them sound like booleans? So something like: 
```suggestion
            boolean isDone = Boolean.parseBoolean(tokens[1]);
```
There are a few of these in other classes as well, so you may want to consider them too

It seems your approach to loading back the data is to save the entire command strings and parse them when you want to load the data in, reconstructing the tasks this way. I think this could potentially result in save file bloating if there are multiple repeated delete commands, although this is not a big issue given the scale of the project. Would it be better to convert Tasks into some kind of save string format that you can use to reconstruct the Task?

I found several lines that will need modifications to follow the module's coding standard. These will be easily flagged out once you complete the CheckStyle task. In summary:
- * imports should be avoided
- Certain class names can be clearer, e.g. `Todos` could be rename `Todo` since it represents a single entity, and `SaveTasks` currently sounds like a verb.
- Use whitespaces around operators consistently
- avoid indenting case clauses in switch statements

I believe the course's [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#naming) requires us to use verbs for methods.

> Names representing methods must be verbs and written in camelCase.
> ```getName(), computeTotalWidth()```

Perhaps we could use something like `sendGreeting()` or `greet()`?

This issue is repeated in subsequent lines of `Ui.java` as well:
 * `farewell()` -&gt; `sendFarewell` or `bidFarewell`?
 * `helpMessage()` -&gt; `sendHelpMessage` or `showHelpMessage`?

Could we perhaps restructure the `if-else` blocks to avoid using a triply-nested `if-else` block here? 

Alternatively, you may consider using a `switch-case` block with a `case` for each of the command. In that case, the necessary `if-else` checks for each command can be placed in its own `case` block without [deep nesting](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-deep-nesting).

You wrote this function to parse and execute the command provided. However, as a result, it is really long and difficult to read the different cases. Perhaps you could consider refactoring out the different execution codes to separate functions so that it is much cleaner and readable.

It seems like markAsDone(), markAsUndone() and setIsDone(isDone) all serve the purpose of setting this.isDone property. I'm not really sure about the value of setIsDone() being executed in other parts of your codebase as this is bad practice; Ideally it should only be called within the class itself. Perhaps you could consider just removing setIsDone() and using markAsDone() and markAsUndone() for the rest of the codebase. That way you can do proper error handling within the functions themselves too.

Overall, I think your code looks good! My only concern is for people reviewing your code in the future, understanding the parsing and executing of the command may be a little too tedious and difficult so you could consider abstracting them into separate functions.

for the DukeException however i believe it would be better if you could create individual exceptions for each exception case as it would make the exception handling structure better! right now a DukeException being thrown will not let us know anything unless we read the message that is also thrown, but i think the exception itself should give some information as well (sorry for the repeat comment I had not put it in the PR review section properly)

Minor issue no worries! However the switch statements style is different for this module.

I got the following from the module website.

```
switch (condition) {
case ABC:
    statements;
    // Fallthrough
case DEF:
    statements;
    break;
case XYZ:
    statements;
    break;

Something that could be done, is that since it seems that you are only using `ui` to print certain strings, maybe you could use `ui` as a static class, that way you don't need to keep parsing it in as a variable, you could just do `Ui.showGoodbye()`

I like how u provide additional comments for your variables and code to help me understand better. I like the naming of methods, especially the boolean methods which are really clear what the method is for. The imports are also grouped together for related imports, which is something I like as well. Great use of constants to reduce duplicate code. Very consistent format of code. I like the comprehensive test cases as well. Could not spot any coding standard violations throughout. Well Done!

Would you consider adding more header comments before non-private classes and methods, so that future reviewers can understand your project better?

Overall, I like how clean your code is and how well encapsulated everything is. There was not much repetition of code and everything that can be extracted out was made as methods. Another very neat trick was separating the task files into different directories respectively, making it very clear for others to follow and trace through. Good Job!

Hi, just a thought on naming convention. 
Might this be slightly confusing as a class name due to the use of a verb at the front? After some looking I can see that the class here refers to a command that involves adding of tasks. 

_Perhaps it could even be renamed to CommandToAdd!_

I'm not sure if I'm right but I believe this method serves to return the list size? If so, I think it would be a plus to take advantage of the naming convention as you have for other methods - i.e. getSize() üòÑ
