* Details about tP grading are [here]({{ url_module_website }}/admin/tp-grading.html).
* Note that the progress shown here is just a rough guidance as it was generated by an automated script. ==A manual inspection will be done after the final submission== to confirm the script's findings.
* Meaning of colors/icons:
  * %%{{ icon_info }}%% : you can click on this icon to find more info
  * <span class="badge bg-success">ABC</span> : you have done the corresponding item.
  * <span class="badge bg-info">ABC</span> : you have done the corresponding item which is an optional item (well done!).
  * <span class="badge bg-danger">!~~ABC~~</span> : item overdue, you have not done the corresponding item yet.
  * <span class="badge bg-dark">!~~ABC~~</span> : item due soon, not done yet.
  * <span class="badge bg-secondary">!~~ABC~~</span> : optional item due soon, not done yet.
  * The [?] suffix (e.g., <span class="badge bg-dark">ABC [?]</span>) indicates there are no data for that item yet. It will be updated in a later time when the relevant data are available.
* If you have queries about the data shown in this page, please email `{{ module | lower }}@comp.nus.edu.sg`.
* This dashboard is **updated {{ "every 2-3 days" if tic4002 else "daily" }}**.
