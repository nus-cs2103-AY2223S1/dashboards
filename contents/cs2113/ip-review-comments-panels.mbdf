Looks great overall! I like how you took into account the case when there weren't any tasks inputted yet. And I also like how you defined all the constants in your Duke.java file so that the subsequent code was easier to read. Apart from minor cosmetic changes, the code is pretty easy to read.

In the for loop, you could remove the space in "i ++", such that it follows this suggested coding guideline in the se-edu website:

But I would also suggest for you to edit the text-ui-test files. It would not only help in debugging, but other reviewers can also see the output of your code without having to run it on their own IDEs.

Generally very easy and enjoyable to read and have no big issues whatsoever. The only coding convention issue that I have spotted which was prevalent in most files were the inconsistent whitespaces between keywords, parentheses and braces, and else keyword not being on the same line as closing braces.

I don't think it's logical to place something related to adding to the list in the constructor for this class; would having it in its own `printAddToListMessage` method , or `Main`'s `execute` methods be a better place for it? (`Todo` and `Event` also have this output line.)

As with all other methods that you use to process the user's inputs, I think it might be easier if switch-case statements were used instead so that there isn't a need to keep reading the user's input again and again? Another suggestion would be to have these methods in a separate Parser class that deals with breaking down and processing the user's input.

-- Coding Standards --
I think you did a great job with coding standards; I don't see any explicit violations. The only suggestions I really have for this is to add Javadoc comments. And while nothing is hard to understand, you could consider adding more comments in the code in the future when things begin to get more complicated.

I only see one naming convention you could consider correcting.

Small comment - perhaps the checkmark and the brackets (the icons indicating the done status of the tasks) can be stored in a constant. This is definitely not strictly necessary, but it may save you some time if you ever have to type the checkmark again (instead of remembering the keyboard command or having to copy-and-paste the checkmark symbol, you can simply refer to the constant).

Perhaps you can consider moving task management-related logic code into a class of its own (e.g. `addTask`, `isWithinTaskRange`, and `markTask` can be moved into a new class whose purpose is solely to manage tasks).

Perhaps consider making the constants `MAX_TASKS` and `BORDER_DECORATION` `private` or `protected`. Though these variables do not pose any immediate security issues, I feel that classes outside the scope of this project should not have direct access to the variables and hence, the access modifier should be reduced from `public` to either `protected` or `private`.

In your Duke, you use `userInput.contains("un")` inside the if statement `userInput.contains("mark")`. I think it may not be correct since you might have your input containing "un" from other words, for example: todo university blablabla. If I input commend of marking this task, it will do unmark instead of marking since you first check if it is "unmark" using `userInput.contains("un")`.

Another suggestion would be to use a switch statement instead of if-else since you are checking only for an equality sign for each input received. Other than that, I like the usage of having a task list class to do the job of adding and marking tasks.

Perhaps you can rename function's name for this situation. Just by the name alone I thought it meant that it simply echos whatever input was given through CLI, but thats not the case. Try giving it a more relevant name to its feature, e.g. "printTaskAddedMessage()".

There seems to be 2 main functions, Greet and TaskManager. Maybe can combine both into one to make one of it the main function.
Would be better if you are able to continuously taking in inputs and adding them to tasks instead of having only 3 inputs.
For taking in of commands, maybe it will be better not to replace the words in the commands. Instead, can just split the string and obtain different parts if the commands.
Displayed some OOP concepts such as Classes.
