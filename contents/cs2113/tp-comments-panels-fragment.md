Because by importing the entire CommandStructure still feels like wildcard import since unused parameters is in CommandStructure.

I have looked at the code changes, everything seems good and the adoption of the Separation of Concern principle is effective. Moreover, the code is modular and extensible in a way we can now focus on developing features separate from the parser as it is handled by a common class already. Thanks for the changes!

There are errors in the commenting style in this PR pertaining to the use of period in-line comments. As for the header comments, the coding style specifies that we have to use the plural form at the start of the header line. Another thing is that for the exception thrown, we don't specify what is the exception, but rather, explain when the exception is thrown, e.g. If... happens. Refer to the below image as an example.

As @wcwy had to focus on the refactoring of parser portion yesterday, I have fixed the severe bug this morning. Basically, the issue lies in the categories list not being cleared each time the instance is re-called, so it builds on its existing list.

Thanks for finding this bug @chinhan99, and @paullowse for the attempt to fix the issue!

Thank you for this feedback! One of our user stories required that the user would like similar features to be grouped under the same family of commands so that it is easy for him/her to remember which command perform which type of related function. In this scenario, adding an income or expense falls under the addition of a transaction into the list, which is why both are classified under the `Add` command instead of two separate commands on its own. 

Nonetheless, we are appreciative of this feedback.

Thank you for bringing this up. This is the correct and intended behavior implemented for our `List` and `Stats` command, whereby the week is counted from Monday and before (for weekly) and the before first day of the month (for monthly).

For example, if I am requesting for the last two weeks:
If the date is 21 October 2022 to backdate 2 weeks, the range will be 3 October to 16 October 2022.

Thank you very much for bringing this up!

We did not allow a month without a year as it does not seem like a valid functionality to list all of the same months from different years. Nonetheless, I recognize your concern of wanting to compare transactions in a given month for each year, which seems like a probable need for our users. We will take your suggestion into consideration.

Hello, thank you for producing this scenario above. I understand that it is not very intuitive to find transactions this way, we will look into it to see how we can restrict the filtering for dates accordingly.

Thank you very much for spotting this issue, I appreciate it a lot. This is a serious bug as it was not intended this way. Instead, it was intended that categorical savings should show how much the user has saved (which is from Income - Expense), not adding all the amounts together. We will attempt to rectify this issue.

Thank you for your suggestion. As Moolah Manager was intended to have one word categories, what you could consider is to make your categories as such, e.g. "asiasoftGames", "asiasoft_games".

After consideration, we will not be adding this feature for now as the scope of users who will require to view a specific month for different years in a transaction list is small. In the meantime, if you wish to view the expenditure statistics, you may use the stats command which provides a similar functionality.

We may consider this suggestion again in future iterations.

After discussion with my team, the above intended feature is indeed correct, i.e. **last** N weeks or months refer to the previous weeks and months without taking into consideration of the present. You may read here to find out more about this scheme - https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-this-past-week-last-week-this-week

To implement the above suggestion, what will be done instead is a workaround - to get transactions by the **last** few days, as per this issue: https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W12-2/tp/issues/211.

Thank you for the suggestion. Our team felt that having a confirmation message for each single delete may hinder the user experience and add inconvenience for him/her. However, we do have a confirmation message in the purge command to ensure that the user can think carefully before deleting all transactions, which may have serious effects.

HI, thank you for the review.
The definition of duplication of address means having addresses with the exact same detail (case insensitive).
For example, `18 College Ave East #01-01, Singapore 138593`  and  `18 College Ave East #01-02, Singapore 138593` are completely different addresses.
Hence, the same should apply to `18 College Ave East, Singapore 138593` as well.

Of course, having the same street name for different address format is still illogical but at this iteration there is no plan to implement such form of validation as it is impossible to achieve without any external API that checks against entire Singapore address database.

Hence, I shall put a disclaimer in the user guide later.

HI, thank you for the review.
First, it is entirely ok for properties to have the same postal code. (Title a bit misleading)
For example, `18 College Ave East #01-01, Singapore 138593` and `18 College Ave East #01-02, Singapore 138593` are completely different properties but can have the same postal code.

However, I do agree that having different street names for the same postal code is illogical but at this iteration there is no plan for such form of validation to be implemented as it is impossible to achieve without any external API that checks against entire Singapore address database. Without the API,  it is impossible to determine which of the conflicting street name is the correct one.

Hence, I shall put a disclaimer in the user guide later.

Since we are extracting the methods used for parsing tags from AddCommand out so that it can be used for other commands, I think a better naming for it is to call it a "TagParser" or "ParameterParser" inside the Parser package. In this case, we will have a CommandParser (the current Parser.java) and a ParameterParser to parse the whole commands entered by the user into "commands" and "parameters".

I will help to do this later since I need to make some changes on command parsing later too to move all the parsing methods used in the command package into the parser package, so that our code structure follows the Separation of Concern principle.

If the user changes the file to make the format into an invalid format, for example, changing the amount in the file to "a", I believe running this line directly could throw an exception in which the error message is catered for user command execution and not a storage initialization. 

You might want to add more try catches for each possible exception and throw a more suitable error message, or to perform separate check for each individual parameter first before calling the command, for a different error message than the one used by user command execution.

In fact, I feel that this method can be modified into getlastNTransactionsWithinDateRange(int numOfType, LocalDate dateRange) instead. In this way, we do not need to pass the "type" around, and the calling method can simply call the getWeekRange() or getMonthRange() itself to get the dateRange before passing into this function.

The if-else here seems to rely on the usage of assert to ensure that no other input for "type" is accepted other than WEEKS or MONTHS. AFAIK, this is not the recommended way of using assert.

I would suggest changing this if-else into if-elseif-else instead, and to throw an error when the else part of the code is arrived at. This way, we do not rely on the assert to ensure that the type is only WEEKS or MONTHS.

User story is moved to Milestone v2.0 due to insufficient time. While the edit command is not implemented, a user can perform the editing of a transaction by deleting the transaction and adding it with the edited parameter(s) instead.

Spot on! The bug happens as when the total expense amount is calculated, a loop was used to iterate through the transaction list to sum up the amount. However, there was no check to ensure that the transaction type is an "expense", thus the amount of the "income" type transactions is also added to the total sum.

It would be good if we can create a new package caused commands to store all types of commands. 
i.e. 
1 abstract Command class to house all the execute method
1 class that inherits from Command for AddCommand to differentiate passenger add and flight add
1 class that inherits from Command for DeleteCommand to differentiate passenger delete and flight delete
1 class that inherits from Command for ListCommand to differentiate passenger list and flight list

Intended functionality of the storage function as the file will be overwritten and not appended at the end of each session. Users are not meant to touch the data.txt file but in the event that they do and they randomly mess with the file the normal functionality of YAMOM will not be compromised. But will indicate in the UG. Might consider adding this error message but may not add it as the error will not occur again if the user uses YAMOM as intended. Which is through the CLI.

The import function will switch the current semester to the semester indicated in the link as it is meant for you to see the timetable that you have just imported.  Why import a timetable and not want to make any changes to it? We do not want to hassle the user to have to change semesters in order to edit their imported timetable.  Will indicate this in the DG.

Could you instead provide the actual commands input in YAMOM instead of telling the steps? If the error is repeatable then it would probably be a bug and not a user error. Will test it out to see if it occurs on our end.

Honestly , I dont think theres a need, but I saw that the original addExpense() and addIncome() methods return a String value. Though I could technically use the original methods without dealing with the return value and leave the value unhandled, I created the new methods without a return so its more "correct" since there's no return value to handle in Storage.java, and there would not be any warnings flagged out.

I believe you are misunderstanding the sentence "Words in UPPERCASE information to be supplied by the user. " - The UPPERCASE information simply refers to the field user must input.

If you look at the feature descriptions below, you will find that we mention that the user supplied input is not case-sensitive.

It seems a bit iffy there is no validation step i.e. users need only pass in their username which is just their full name in PascalCase
In the future, we can think about whether we want a validation step, for example, asking for a user's NRIC(similar to a library), such that only owners of item/transactions can update them

- For now, we simply apply additions/updates/deletes on `Transaction` or `Item` by their `id` without any validation

## Responsibility of CI tests should be on PR creator
As I was creating my PR I realised that there were too many changes by others that cause errors and warnings by both the compiler and Checkstyle.  This is a problem because these errors cause CI tests to fail i.e. we have some build error caused by our own changes and so the responsibility lies with the PR creator to fix this. If we each do not check our own, then someone else has to fix all of the errors(i think Bui has been helping to do this) which isn't fair and is a waste of dev time.
- For the Checkstyle warnings, you may ignore "missing javadoc" warnings ONLY - the rest will CI checks to fail
- For example, we have some code that has lines > 100 characters in multiple files and we have some files that have no spaces before entering a new block e.g. `if (condition){`

## Suggested PR workflow
Given that we are skipping the forking workflow and not proper code reviews, it is a good idea for us to make sure we are submitting code of sufficient quality. This means that at the very minimum we should ensure that our PR passes the CI tests before clicking on merge.
For subsequent milestones after 1.5, I suggest we follow this workflow.

### 1. Starting out
- `git checkout master` to ensure you are at master branch
- `git pull upstream master` to ensure you have latest code from upstream
- `git checkout -b <branchName>` to create a branch locally and switch to that branch
- Work on whatever you want to work on
- After finishing your work, ensure you are in project directory i.e. `tp` then run `checkstyle **/*.java` to check for all errors
- Fix any errors that are not related to JavaDocs
- `git add ...` to stage all your changes
- `git commit ...` to  commit all your changes
- `git push -u origin <branch_name>` to push your new branch to your fork(origin) and track it

### 2. Before creating PR
- Check if someone else's PR is open. If there is another open PR, wait for it to close - he is probably fixing errors and waiting for CI tests to pass before merging.
  - Creating a PR before he merges just wastes time
- If no PR is open, then:
  -  Run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest changes in case someone else has merged to upstream before you create your PR
  - If already at latest change, move to step 3. Otherwise:
  - Resolve any merge conflicts
  - Push your branch once again to your fork with `git push`
  - Create a PR from your branch in origin (forkName/<branch_name>) to upstream(AY2223S1-CS2113-W12-1/master)

### 3. After creating a PR
- Wait for all CI tests to pass
- If CI test passes, move to step 4. Otherwise:
- Fix any parts of your code if the CI tests fails, and push the fixes
- Continue this process until all CI test passes

### 4. Before clicking merge PR
- By now all CI tests based on your changes should have passed
- Click merge PR

We need to populate the secret.txt file with a default api key instead of keeping it in a variable. This is so that the loading of key will be as expected. @pipipipi2002 

Need to update the initialisation part also, if no text found, we tell them we create the data file, and populate with the default API key. They are free to change using the auth command

Not an issue as this is by design. Export to text prints out the existing builds whether or not the have components. While in exporCSV the rows represent each component while buildname is a column, so if there are no components then the rows will be empty.

We have fixed this. In actuality the component of type garbo was not added as "you have added..." was a default output even for types that did not exist. In the tested version of our program a component of non existent type could not be added into our program anyway. The reason why list showed that component was because a cpu with those fields was added earlier.
