Good day professor,

Since in our development guide we would be describing each one of our program's functionality, are we expected to have a sequence diagram for each one of these functions?

Furthermore, within the class diagrams used to describe a particular functionality of our program, are we expected to specify every variable/method within the classes in our class diagram or do we only need to specify the variable and methods within each class that the particular functionality uses.

Gradle is given me this error regarding my styling and i dont seem to understand why am i having this error. This is because, per the coding convention, all my declarations are done at the start of the method.

I have refactored my code to make it more OOP before committing and marking it with the A-MoreOOP tag. However, while doing the Level-9 increment, I refactored some portion of my code not previously refactored to make it more OOP.

Thus, can I add this refactor under the Level - 9 increment since i have already done the bulk of the refactoring previously and tagged it as  A-MoreOOP.

Hi, it was mentioned that when we are checking to see if a variable is value A or Value B, we shouldn't do 
if (variable == value A) {
//Do something
}else{
// Assuming that the variable is value B and do something.
}
I get that the rationale for doing this is because the variable can hold more than 2 values thus we cant assume that if it isnt value A, it would be value B.

However, for my case above , i am checking the value of a boolean thus can i use the if statement to check if the boolean is true and for the else statement, i would assume it is false since it can only take on two values.

Hi prof,

For the level 4 commit, I have added the functionalities of level 4 as well as having rearranged some of my functions by placing it into a new class called decoder as well as a superclass called command which has subclass for each type of command such as add new task. Thus for the commit message, this is all I am able to write due to the java convention of the commit message subject having a hard limit of 72 words. Is the above commit message sufficient or do I require further elaboration?

Hi Prof,
Just to confirm, are we allowed to have with us a hardcopy piece of paper so that we can jot down the types of commands we would be trying beforehand such as empty fields in the command so that we have sort of planned out the sequence of the test beforehand in that sense.

I'm trying to match the formatting of my code output to the problem description.

However, this is not reflected in the Coursemology expected output. For the second input, the expected output does not have a new line to begin the "Total in local currency" line. So, which format should we be adhering to: Coursemology's or the CS2113 website's? Also, I'm not sure why my result for the first input is being marked as incorrect...

Sure - here are my print statements. (The helper methods extractPrices() and calculateTotal() do not return any new line characters; all the newline characters are from the "System.out.println" calls).

I suppose I could hard-code it so that the formatting is dependent on the input, but I think that might be frowned upon. 😂 Perhaps there is an issue with the test cases themselves?

In my code, I use a switch block to decide what to do with the inputs (e.g. list, mark, unmark). The default of the switch block will just print out a message similar to the one shown in the picture above. It is very short and I feel that modifying my code to include the exception would reduce the readability by a lot.

The website says that the minimal requirement is to handle the stated types of errors, but I'm hesitant to, and would thus like a second opinion on this. Thank you :)

while (!input.equals("bye")) {            //input refers to the user's input
     String[] arrOfInputStrings = input.split(" ");
     
     switch(arrOfInputStrings[0]) {
     case "list":
           displayList(tasks, taskCounter);
           break;
     //other cases
     default:
           invalid_input();
           break;
     }
     
     input = in.nextLine();
}
```
&hat;So the `invalid_input()` would take care of invalid inputs that are not specific to the different commands. 
(I have done up exceptions for the other commands like list and todo). 

I can't think of a nice way to implement exceptions that wouldn't bloat the code.

You need to remove the space at the end of "Expenses in overseas currency: " and avoid println for both. My code looks like yours but with those two changes it manages to pass both test cases.

Use two backslashes before the [ brackets. Like so:
`String temp = a.replaceAll("\\[]\\[hi]", "hey");`

I don't know why backslashes are not required for the ] brackets. I tried
`String temp = a.replaceAll("\\[\\]\\[hi\\]", "hey");`

first and it gave me the same result, but IntelliJ recommended removing the apparently redundant escapes before the ] brackets so I did.

The string is treated as regex so it probably has something to do with that.

Hi Prof,

I am running Intellij on a mac. I have used /n to represent line breaks in my JUNIT test cases.
But when I upload to Github, the CI for Windows shows an error saying it does  not match.
I then booted up Windows on a virtual machine and saw this LF and CRLF mismatch on my expected and actual test cases on intellij IDE.

These test cases work fine on Mac. The Github CI is working well for mac and Linux, but failing for Windows. All my test cases are failing because of this and I am not sure how to fix it.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks prof!

Since [ and ] are special characters in a string, if i write something like
String temp = a.replaceAll("[  ][hi]", "hey");
it is not going to work.

I remember we needed to use some '/' and '\' but couldn't remember exactly how :(

I tried the second method and the credential helper window still pops out when I tried to push, and after I selected "wincred" it seemed to work somehow. I suppose the credential helper is not supposed to appear, but eventually, it still worked without giving errors.

Hi there, my team and I are having a dilemma in fixing a CI Failing issue in one of our pull requests.

While inspecting the Java CI check logs in the 'merge pull request' page on GitHub, we found the following errors:
```
 Error: eckstyle] [ERROR] /home/runner/work/tp/tp/src/main/java/seedu/duke/UI.java:13: <p> tag should be placed immediately before the first word, with no space after. [JavadocParagraph]
Error: eckstyle] [ERROR] /home/runner/work/tp/tp/src/main/java/seedu/duke/UI.java:13: <p> tag should be preceded with an empty line. [JavadocParagraph]
```

The offending JavaDoc in question is the following:
```
    /**
     * Prints a line on the console based on the default parameters defined in this Java class.
     * <p>
     * Source: Team Member Alan Low's iP codebase
     * Link: ...
     */
    protected void printLine() {
        <code body>
    }
```

Based on the [CheckStyle documentation](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/javadoc/JavadocParagraphCheck.html), the following change will resolve the issue:
```
    /**
     * Prints a line on the console based on the default parameters defined in this Java class.
     * 
     * <p>Source: Team Member Alan Low's iP codebase
     * Link: ...
     */
    protected void printLine() {
        <code body>
    }
```

However, the proposed fix will go against the recommended JavaDoc documentation style as defined in [Oracle's Java documentation webpage](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html).

Could someone kindly advise my team and I on how we can resolve the Java CI check failures without breaking the coding standard? Thank you in advance 🙂

Hi there, I would like to seek clarification on the behaviour of our iP chatbot program when adding tasks.

In [Week 3](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html#2-add-increments-commit-tag-push-level-1-level-2-level-3-a-codingstandard), we programmed our chatbots to add any text entered by the user to its list (as long as the text is not "list" or "bye"), and in [Week 4](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#2-add-increments-level-4-a-textuitesting-a-codequality), we are adding three new specific types of tasks for the user to specify.

I was wondering with the addition of the three specific task types, does this mean that any text without the appropriate 'command' will now be considered an error? For example, now that we have `todo read book`, is `read book` without the `todo` command now an invalid command?

Thank you in advance 🙂

Perhaps you can try rebuilding your project (Build > Rebuild project). ([Reference: Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45486856))

Another shot in the dark is to double-check that you've set your 'program language level' to 'SDK default' in the project structure settings.

Hii, I've had no issues with earlier commits and pushing but it seems like after I've requested the upstream pull request yesterday, I am unable to perform a Push (no issues with staging). I have not changed any settings between then and now so I am quite puzzled about what could be the reason for this issue.

For the full output it is as below:
git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false --no-optional-locks push -v --tags origin master:master

For performing git push on command line/ should i just type git push with no flags? Sorry I'm not too familiar with using git on CLI

I've tried the `git push` using CLI and it was similarly loading with no error messages or warnings - which led me to believe that the problem was with my Git rather than SourceTree. After updating my Git to the latest version, I am able to successfully push with no issues.

I don't think these are best practices, but one way I got around this was to refactor my code such that user command parsing and the creation of new Todo/Deadline/Event objects are handled by separate methods. This allows the switch statement to follow SLAP (single-level of abstraction principle).

I'm also not too sure how to handle different kinds of exceptions, though. I made my custom exceptions take in a different error message when each Todo/Deadline/Event method throws them, so that any exceptions caught from the DukeException class will just print the error message supplied (in accordance with the subclass object handled by method), but I don't know how good I feel about this :'(

It seems like your `invalid_input()` method already corresponds to the second type of errors that should be handled? 
As for the first type of error-handling required for `Level-5`, which catches the case where no descriptions supplied for Todo commands, couldn't you just implement it within the "todo" case of your switch statement? And if you're worried about code quality, you can always consider refactoring your code by extracting a method from the "todo" case.

I read online that it's also tricky to implement unique exceptions for classes in an inheritance hierarchy (super and subclasses, in this case Task vs Todo/Deadline/Exception). For now I've created a generic exception that would tell the user that the description is missing, but how should I go about being able to override the message for subclasses Todo/Deadline/Event?

My team is also facing this issue and we would like to know what we should do in this situation, whether to keep to the checkstyle's 4 spacing for now, or to use 8 spaces and modify checkstyle instead.

Hi, in the team dashboard, it seems to be tracking Junit test as a task to be done, does this mean we need to do Junit testing every week? Or are we allowed to rotate weeks on implementation.

E.g.
This week we push out functional code, the next week we push out Junit Testing code.

Thank you!

Are you using a For-Each loop to loop through the shapes array by any chance? Since we initialized an array of size 100 but only added 4 shapes, the NullPointerException error will be encountered when the loop iterates to the 5th element in the shapes array.
