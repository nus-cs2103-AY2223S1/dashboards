This part feel a bit off, don't think it should be put like this here. A bit inconsistence. Try see other part on how the run the logging. It is ok to put the log into a file, but should be done together with the other logger

listGroup sounds like an action. I think we should keep to groupList as it is closer to a noun.

The model.group.GroupList is the list of all the available group. The used of static tells so. Should not appear in person. But however, we do need another list to show the list of group which the person is in. I think using set or arraylist is good.

I still think that you should refactor into somewhere else or another class. The AssignCommand class shouldn't handle any file related items or logger item.

Will it be added in? Cause currently, the addressbook.json only store the list of group created, it didn't store who is inside the group.

That won't work for this case as mentioned in the comment above. The GroupList class that we used is for a different purpose which is to track and manage all the group created. What we need is a list of group for the specific person. Based on your current code, 1 person is only allowed to be in 1 group. I think it should be that 1 person could be in any number of groups. It is either we need a new class, or use arraylist, list, set, etc. to store it,
